# HAND_GESTURE_CONTROL_CAR

Title: Hand Gesture Control Car with Arduino and OpenCV

Description:

This project implements a real-time hand gesture control system for a car using Arduino and OpenCV. It allows users to control the car's movements (forward, backward, left, right, stop) through hand gestures captured by a webcam.

Features:

Real-time hand gesture recognition with OpenCV
Arduino-based car control using motor driver circuits (specifics to be added based on your setup)
Intuitive control mapping for forward, backward, left, right, and stop actions
(Optional) User-friendly interface for calibration or configuration (if applicable)
Hardware Requirements:

Arduino Uno or compatible board (adjust based on your board)
Motor driver circuits (e.g., L298N, specify component names)
DC motors (specify motor specifications)
Webcam
Connecting wires (breadboard wires or jumper cables)
(Optional) Additional hardware for user interface (e.g., buttons, LEDs, specify components if used)
Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE (download from https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)
OpenCV library (installation instructions for your OS: https://opencv.org/releases/)
(Optional) Additional libraries for user interface elements (if used)
Setup Instructions:

Install Software:

Download and install Arduino IDE.
Follow the installation instructions for OpenCV on your operating system.
(Optional) Install any additional libraries needed for your user interface.
Connect Hardware:

Connect your Arduino board to the motor driver circuits according to the driver's datasheet.
Connect the DC motors to the motor driver outputs.
Connect the webcam to your computer.
(Optional) Connect any user interface components to the Arduino board as per your design.
Load and Modify Code:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Download the project code (replace with instructions on how to obtain your code).
In the code, update the following sections (if applicable):
Pin assignments for motor control (adjust pin numbers to match your hardware connections)
Hand gesture recognition thresholds (fine-tune these values for optimal performance)
User interface button/LED functionalities (if applicable)
Upload and Run:

Select your Arduino board and serial port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
Open a serial monitor to view any debugging messages or sensor readings (if implemented).
Run your OpenCV program to capture the webcam feed and control the car with hand gestures.
